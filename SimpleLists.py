Instructions:
Read through the code and predict what the program
does. Check your prediction by running the code.
You may have notice that nothing happens! Add a
breakpoint on line 35 and run the code line-by-line.
What information does it give you about each list?

Currently, the program creates three lists and
stores some values in the lists, which isn't
very exciting. Let's display the list plants
by adding the following line of code...
print(plants)

How is the list displayed? How would you display
animals and scores?

Modify this line of code...
plants = ["carrot", "celery", "onion"]

so it looks like this...
plants = ["carrot, celery, onion"]

Add a breakpoint on line 10 and run the program
line-by-line. How many elements does the list have?
'''

animals = []
plants = ["carrot", "celery", "onion"]
scores = [75, 85, 66, 93]
